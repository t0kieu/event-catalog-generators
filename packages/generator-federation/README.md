# Core Features

- 🕋 Federation for EventCatalog. Merge many catalogs into one master catalog
- 🧑🏻‍💻 Let your teams control their own catalogs, and merge them into a master catalog
- ⚡️ Git based generator, supports any git repo (e.g GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Specify the git repo, it's branch and the files you want to merge into your master catalog
- ✅ Configuration to override files and ensure all files in the catalog are unique

# How it works

[EventCatalog](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/) is technology agnostic, meaning it can integrate with any schemas, specs or brokers.

EventCatalog supports [generators](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/docs/development/plugins/generators).
Generators are scripts are run to pre build to generate content in your catalog. Generators can use the [EventCatalog SDK](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/docs/sdk).

With this git generator you can connect to many git repos, and merge them into a master catalog.

This let's your teams control their own catalogs, and merge them into a master catalog, keeping the documentation close to the their code.

```js
...
generators: [
    [
      '@eventcatalogtest/generator-federation',
      {
        // The git repo to clone
        source: 'https://github.com/event-catalog/eventcatalog.git',

        // The branch to clone, defaults to main
        branch: 'main',

        // Array of copy configurations - specify what content to copy and where to put it
        copy: [
          {
            // The content to clone, this can be a single file or an array of files
            content: ['/domains'],
            // The destination to clone the content to
            destination: path.join(catalogDir, 'domains'),
          },
          {
            // You can have multiple copy configurations
            content: '/services',
            destination: path.join(catalogDir, 'services'),
          }
        ],

        // Optional: Override existing files (default: false)
        override: false,

        // Optional: Ensure all resources have unique IDs (default: false)
        enforceUniqueResources: false,
      },
    ],
  ],
...
```

In this example we are:

1. Cloning "domains" from the git repo and merging them into the catalog's domains directory
2. Cloning "services" and merging them into the catalog's services directory

When merging many repositories you can use the `override` option to override files in the catalog.
You can also use the `enforceUniqueResources` option to ensure all resources in the catalog are unique (to help with naming conflicts).
