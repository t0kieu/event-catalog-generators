# EventCatalog EventBridge Example

This example shows you how to ingest events from EventBridge into EventCatalog.
With [schema discovery enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-schema-registry.html), you can discover schemas in your event bus and import them into EventCatalog.

This gives you the ability to add semantic meaning to your events in EventBridge, assign them to services and domains.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account

## Setup

1. Clone this project
1. Run `npm install`
1. Get a EventCatalog license key from [EventCatalog](https://eventcatalog.cloud) (14 day free trial)
1. Run the init.sh script to create the EventBridge bus and start the schema discovery
1. Run the send-events.sh script to send events to EventBridge
